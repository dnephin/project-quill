Phase 1 - Statement
- update requires _rev
- _id should include label/version
- after add() ember does not redirect to edit
- after publish() does not redirect to view
- implement responses

Phase 2 - Cleanup

- composite action for ApiAction, UserApiAction, etc
- remove lookup user from Statement Controller actions
- SubCut for testing
- include label in statement db?
