Phase 1 - Statement
- add edit link
- implement response objects


Phase 2 - Cleanup

- fixtures for user, and update Statement fixtures to match
- add display name to user maybe? or just use fullName
- include label in statement db
    - friendly label on add
    - update handler for add
- composite action for ApiAction, UserApiAction, etc
- remove lookup user from Statement Controller actions
- SubCut for testing
