Phase 1 - Statement
- after add() ember does not redirect to edit
- after publish() does not redirect to view
- include label in statement db
    - friendly label on add
    - update handler for add
- implement response objects


Phase 2 - Cleanup

- composite action for ApiAction, UserApiAction, etc
- remove lookup user from Statement Controller actions
- SubCut for testing
