## Development

One of the many goals of Project Quill is to allow a new developer to get up
and running in just a couple minutes. To accomplish this
[vangrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) is used to construct a development
environment from a configuration.

To get started follow these steps:

1. [Install vagrant](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html)

2. Add a vagrant box of 64 bit Ubuntu 13.04

    vagrant box add raring64 http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/vagrant/raring/current/raring-server-cloudimg-amd64-vagrant-disk1.box

3.
