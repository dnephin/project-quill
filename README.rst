Project Quill
=============

An open source group decision making tool.

Background
----------

The last few decades of progression in information technology have given us many 
tools for communicating and collaborating with each other. However, most of 
those tools are focused on casual interaction and popularity contents. There is 
a distinct lack of tools which address one of the fundamental modes of 
communication in our society.

From small student groups and communities, to thousand person national 
organizations, everyone relies on some form of communication to make decisions 
as group.

An online tool which is capable of facilitating the process of making a decision

Features

This section outlines a potential prototype for such a system. Many of the 
details can and probably should change as the tool is used and we learn from 
out experience using it.

Paragraph oriented documented format
- to support responses to a specific paragraph

Discussion branching
- each new thread of discussion is automatically a new branch


Project Plan
------------

The first step is to develop a minimal prototype implementation. There are a lot 
of potential trade-offs involved in a project with this scope. The initial 
prototype should only focus on the most novel ideas.  

The really unique feature of this tool is really the user interface, so it 
should be the immediate focus.

Required skillsets:
 * UX designer
 * Javascript developer
 * democratic organizations
