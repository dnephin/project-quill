There are many tools for online communicating and group discussion making, but
very few are designed to produce actionable, and traceable decisions.

All software has bias. If a software tool is not designed to produce a useful
decision, it is unlikely that it will be fit for that purpose. Most of the tools
we have for communication are designed to be immediately intuitive, and
unobtrusive. To facilitate communication that is relevant in the instant, but
not over time.
