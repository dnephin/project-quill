Project Goals
=============

This project aims to create a tool to facilitate constructive, transparent,
inclusive, and informed group decision making.


Constructive
------------

Make decision a concrete goal with an aim of solving a problem, which is
recorded with the argument.


Transparent
-----------

A record of facts and edits to the decision are tracked by versions. Each
time the document changes, the arguments and feedback behind that change
are preserved.

Inclusive
---------

Support direct participation from all concerned parties. Arguments and
supporting evidence can be contributed direction from the source instead of
through many intermediaries. All parties are able to contribute
arguments and facts to the discussion.

Informed
--------

Support arguments and contributions which can be supported, and reject
arguments without any supporting evidence. Supporting evidence is placed in the
open so it can be vetted by everyone involved.


Group Decision Making
---------------------

Facilitate decision making between large number of people in an organization
or community.
