Project Goals
=============

This project aims to create a tool to facilitate constructive, transparent,
inclusive, and informed group decision making.


Constructive
------------

Decisions are formed around a problem statement. The goal of a decision is to
solve the problem. The original problem is recorded with the decision
making process.


Transparent
-----------

A record of facts and edits to the decision are tracked by versions. Each
time the document changes, the arguments and feedback behind that change
are preserved.

Inclusive
---------

Support direct participation from all concerned parties. Arguments and
supporting evidence can be contributed directly from the source instead of
through many intermediaries. All parties are able to contribute
arguments and facts to the discussion.

Informed
--------

Feedback about statements and contributions can be contributed with
with supporting evidence. This feedback is placed in the open so it can be
vetted by everyone involved.


Group Decision Making
---------------------

Facilitate decision making between large number of people in an organization
or community.
